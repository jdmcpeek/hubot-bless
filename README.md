hubot-bless
===========

Now that cold season is upon us, it's high time we automate our 'bless you's" and "Gezundheit's".  

`hubot bless <name>`
  returns
`<random language blessing>, <name>!` 
  Ex: "God bless you, Davie!"

`hubot in <language> bless <name>`
  returns
`<language blessing>, <name>!`
  Ex: Salud, Davie!
  
  Everyone always feels better after they've been blessed.
